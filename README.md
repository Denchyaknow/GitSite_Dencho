# Dencho's Portfolio Website

## Main Branch: Develop

### Notes for Dencho by Dencho:

### How to Update the Website with New Posts/Projects

1. Navigate to the following path: `content/projects/`

2. Copy or create a new `POSTNAME.md` file in either of the following folders:
   - `content/projects/experiments/` (for experimental work)
   - `content/projects/contracts/` (for contract work)

3. Create a folder with the same name as your post/project to store media. The structure should look like this:

assets/media/projects/POSTNAME/

4. If done correctly, each media relative path would resemble the following:

assets/media/projects/POSTNAME/XRLog_2020_198.webm assets/media/projects/POSTNAME/XRLog_2020_213.webm

5. In the new `POSTNAME.md` file you created, reference the media by following examples from other posts.

6. You can use the frontmatter to give a hero a background image/video, or add a video/image HTML element after the frontmatter. This will still show up in a project listing.
