<p>I wanted a modular magic system that works with physics based grabbables.</p>

<p>So I made one, it has public methods that allow the user (mob or player) to charge mana into the magic spell that is being cast at the time of input.</p>

<p>Once I got spawning pretty good, I added Telekinesis control, after a grabbable is spawned it will track the users appendage until mana is no longer being channeled into the spell.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I started making this, it just seemed fun. I hope to iterate upon it in the future.</p>
