<p>This experiments goal was to iterate on my previous AI Controllers and refine the combat system.</p>

<p>I worked more on the combat skill pathing. It is now more dynamic while still using a physics PID controller to move the rigidbody via forces in additive manner.</p>

<p>Both of these mobs use the same combat system, but one is tweaked to have a shorter travel path, with drag/angulardrag over time (set by a curve and multiplier) which allows me to create something like a bulletTime attack but in realtime.</p>

<p>This kind of system allows other physics objects to alter the pathing trajectory of the mob even while the skill is running.</p>

<p>Even works with drone like locomotion.</p>
