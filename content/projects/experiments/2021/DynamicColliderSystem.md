<p>Colliders that transform with Physics.</p>

<p>The goal of this system was to make hit events more generous relative to the movement of the rigidbody attached to the HurtBox.</p>

<p>This basically works as a Melee auto aim for a XR perspective. If the player thrusts a knife forward sometime VR depth can take getting used to, this makes it easier for players to hit something that might be a few inches father then perceived.</p>

<p>It actually works out pretty well, and I wrote it to be well performant. Just attach to a meshs child collider (box type) that has a rigidbody.</p>
