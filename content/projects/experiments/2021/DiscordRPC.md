<p>A client requested integration with the Discord API, at the time there was no official Discord SDK in C#, I endedup using a Discord API C# wrapper I found on GitHub.</p>

<p>Its just a simple plugin you can import, that hooks into a running discord client and shows a custom activity based on a scriptableObject config you can setup. It works in the Editor and during runtime and can be extended on to use analytical funnels.</p>
