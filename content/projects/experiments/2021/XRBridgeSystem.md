<p>The goal of this experiment was to create a procedural dynamic map out of bridges and hub nodes of my own design.</p>

<p>One problem I encountered was during the Spawning/Despawning of the bridges, framerate would drop on the Quest1 due to performance issues with colliders moving over time. This meant I could only make bridges so long before frames would skip.</p>

<p>It worked well in theory but, in practice it's not that feasible on a low powered device like the Quest1.</p>
