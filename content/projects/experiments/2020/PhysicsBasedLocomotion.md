<p>This was one of the most difficult prototypes for my skill level at the time. The prototype code would need to be refactored before I would attempt putting it into beta testing.</p>

<p>Part of the math I needed to master was how 3D normals and reflections are calculated.</p>

<p>Yes its a Sphere for now, but keep in mind this prototype is using RigidBodies and a Velocity PID controller that I wrote to move the body via Physics.</p>
