<p>I was contacted and contracted out by a School District Manager looking for ways to Adapt XR as a means for kids to learn remotely in a more immersive way.</p>

<p>The things I can show from this project are limited due to an NDA</p>

<p>The main goal of this prototype was to create a UI capable of spawning Chemistry related instances of Molecule models and allow interaction with them for lecturing purposes in a Teacher to Student relationship.</p>
