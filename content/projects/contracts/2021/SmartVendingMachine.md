<p>Contracted to make a "Smart" Vending Machine feature designed to work with VR Players.</p>

<p>NDA Prevents me from showing the UI or final outcome of the feature.</p>

<p>The goal was to create a Vending Machine that had a would automatically adjust to the VR Players Height via a Robot Arm controlled by Inverse Kinematics.</p>

<p>The teams technical artist provided the Vending Machine mesh with armature for the screens housing. The first step was connect the bones to a simple Inverse Kinematic script.</p>

<p>Next I see how it targets the Players Head transform.</p>

<p>With a bit of some C# magic, the Arm for the screen will extend out to any nearby Players Head transform. When the target is out of range for x+ seconds, the screen will retract back into the machine.</p>
