<!--TODO: Add a function or 2 from the tools inspector code and snap a pic of the custom inspector-->

<p>A startup I worked for wanted a full blown MMORPG. Here is some of the work I did that im allowed to show.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is one of my earliest projects involving Web3, at the time (2022) there was but a handful of blockchain SDKs that were compatible with Unity and C#. On top of all the Web3 functionality part of my job was to refine the combat and art workflow for maps.</p>

| Feature         | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Invector Character System**     | A quick start to basic combat, but unacceptable for production. |
| **Better Combat**     | The initial state of combat in the game was subpar at best. |

#### Invector Woes

<p>I'm sure the Invector SDK is usable for a lot of projects. However I have never been more displeased by the code quality in the SDK. It makes me want to throw up and if I could go back to the start of development I would strongly recommend against using it. I ended reverse engineering parts of their character components so that performance would increase by 80%+ during stress testing. This is why it's not recommended to handle null or distance checks every frame. Shame shame.</p>

#### Extending Combat

<p>I started by overriding attack functions to tie into a custom sensor I made that detects other mob sensors. This was then used to input an relative "intent" direction the AI should use for the attack trajectory. I then combined all that with a custom physics PID controller I wrote a while back to make attacks apply forces to the attackers and defenders bodies. </p>
