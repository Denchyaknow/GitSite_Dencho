**Dencho - Game Developer, XR Researcher, and AI Enthusiast**

Dencho is a Senior Gameplay Programmer, XR Researcher, and AI Enthusiast whose journey began with only a blue GameBoyColor early in his childhood. Fascinated by what seemed like pixel magic, he found a love for modding console games and systems for the community of the early 2000s, driven by an insatiable curiosity. At 13 years old, he deployed his own private World of Warcraft server experimenting with MySQL, LUA, Apache, and Dedicated Game Servers, to fund his longboarding hobby for him and his friends. By 16, his passion had evolved into programming, marking the start of his exploration into game development.

With over a decade of experience using Unity and C#, his current focus lies in uniting virtual and augmented reality with artificial intelligence, leveraging machine learning and neural networks to craft intelligent and adaptive systems.
At the heart of his work is a commitment to pushing technological boundaries, by developing features that innovate upon digital experiences he aims to help humanity reach a 3D digitized standard for our world.

Through his dedication, he continues to fight on the front lines of extended reality, creating immersive features that redefine how we engage with digital spaces, transforming them into dynamic, interactive experiences that seamlessly integrate with our everyday lives.
