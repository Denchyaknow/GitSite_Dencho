    title: "This Section can have a different command name"
    titleColor: teal
    content: |
          Here the title and the content can have different colors
          The content can be multi
          
          line

          And spaces       will be respected as well
          This section will have the default command: misc
          but you can name it something else with the property
          commandName: <String>
          Give it a shot and try and uncomment the line 
          commandName: newcommand
          now instead of misc you can execute the newcommand for this section
          Auto completion will know it too! :D
